# LandingZone
A landing zone is a segment of a cloud environment, that has been pre-provisioned through code, and is dedicated to the support of one or more workloads. Landing zones provide access to foundational tools and controls to establish a compliant place to innovate and build new workloads in the cloud, or to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. Landing zones use defined sets of cloud services and best practices to set you up for success.

We leverage Azure enterprise-scale landing zones and propose a Terraform-native structure, set of mechanisms and artifacts to get started to deploy workloads fast.

This landing zone code being divided in different modoules for each type of resources.
E.g.: naming convention
Azure Policy

To use the code engineer must define the values in terraform.tfvars file
